## Key Features

Reef lets you bind applications to number keys and cycle through their windows with an Alt-Tab-like interface.

We built Reef because we wanted a fast and simple window switcher for macOS.

- Bind applications to number keys to refocus to **any** window for that app
- Assign profiles for different sets of bindings
- Do your binding and profile management through the keyboard
- Customizable keyboard shortcuts


## Usage

### Binding
You should start by binding different applications to the number keys. You can do this:
- through **Preferences → Profiles** (accessed through the menu bar), or
- by selecting the application of your choice and then pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd>.

### Profiles
You can also set your bindings up in different profiles.

For example, you may want two profiles:
- "Coding": Which binds your favourite editor, browser, and terminal
- "Browsing": Which binds your favourite web browser, messaging app, and music client

You can switch between profiles:
- using the menu bar, or
- by binding them to the number keys, and then pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>[0-9]</kbd>.

### Switching applications
Suppose you're in your coding profile, and have your editor bound to `0`.

To switch between apps and windows:
1. Hold <kbd>Control</kbd> and press <kbd>0</kbd> to open a panel showing each of your editor's windows.
2. Press <kbd>0</kbd> multiple times to select the specific window you want.
3. Release <kbd>Control</kbd> to switch to the selected window.

In this way, Reef gives every app its own 'Alt-Tab'.

Note that window switching is scoped to your current [macOS space](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mh14112/mac).

### Customization

You can customize the modifiers for switching applications and profiles, and for binding different applications in **Reef Preferences → Shortcuts**.

Reef also pairs well with [Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle):
- Rectangle positions & re-arranges your windows
- Reef re-focuses your windows

## FAQ
<details>
<summary><b>Why is it called "Reef"?</b></summary>
<br>
The name comes from the starting sounds of the words "refocus" and "reframe". And, like a coral reef supports a diverse ecosystem, Reef supports your workspace—helping you navigate between windows quickly and easily.
